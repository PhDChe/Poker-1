RLCard is a toolkit for Reinforcement Learning (RL) in card games. It supports multiple card environments with easy-to-use interfaces. The goal of RLCard is to bridge reinforcement learning and imperfect information games. RLCard is developed by [DATA Lab](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/xiahu/) at Texas A&M University and community contributors.

## Installation
Make sure that you have **Python 3.5+** and **pip** installed. We recommend installing the latest version of `rlcard` with `pip`:

```
git clone https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard.git
cd rlcard
pip install -e .
```
Alternatively, you can install the latest stable version with:
```
pip install rlcard
```
The default installation will only include the card environments. To use Tensorflow implementation of the example algorithms, install the supported verison of Tensorflow with:
```
pip install rlcard[tensorflow]
```
To try PyTorch implementations, please run: 
```
pip install rlcard[torch]
```
If you meet any problems when installing PyTorch with the command above, you may follow the instructions on [PyTorch official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to manually install PyTorch.

We also provide [**conda** installation method](https://anaconda.org/toubun/rlcard):

```
conda install -c toubun rlcard
```

Conda installation only provides the card environments, you need to manually install Tensorflow or Pytorch on your demands.

## Examples
Please refer to [examples/](examples). A **short example** is as below.

```python
import rlcard
from rlcard.agents import RandomAgent

env = rlcard.make('blackjack')
env.set_agents([RandomAgent(action_num=env.action_num)])

trajectories, payoffs = env.run()
```

We also recommend the following **toy examples** in Python.

*   [Playing with random agents](docs/toy-examples.md#playing-with-random-agents)
*   [Deep-Q learning on Blackjack](docs/toy-examples.md#deep-q-learning-on-blackjack)
*   [Running multiple processes](docs/toy-examples.md#running-multiple-processes)

*   [Leduc Hold'em as single-agent environment](docs/toy-examples.md#leduc-holdem-as-single-agent-environment)

R examples can be found [here](docs/toy-examples-r.md).

## Demo
Run `examples/leduc_holdem_human.py` to play with the pre-trained Leduc Hold'em model. Leduc Hold'em is a simplified version of Texas Hold'em. Rules can be found [here](docs/games.md#leduc-holdem).

## Available Environments
We provide a complexity estimation for the games on several aspects. **InfoSet Number:** the number of information sets; **InfoSet Size:** the average number of states in a single information set; **Action Size:** the size of the action space. **Name:** the name that should be passed to `rlcard.make` to create the game environment. We also provide the link to the documentation and the random example.

## API Cheat Sheet
### How to create an environment
You can use the the following interface to make an environment. You may optionally specify some configurations with a dictionary.
*   **env = rlcard.make(env_id, config={})**: Make an environment. `env_id` is a string of a environment; `config` is a dictionary that specifies some environment configurations, which are as follows.
	*   `seed`: Default `None`. Set a environment local random seed for reproducing the results.
	*   `env_num`: Default `1`. It specifies how many environments running in parallel. If the number is larger than 1, then the tasks will be assigned to multiple processes for acceleration.
	*   `allow_step_back`: Defualt `False`. `True` if allowing `step_back` function to traverse backward in the tree.
	*   `allow_raw_data`: Default `False`. `True` if allowing raw data in the `state`.
	*   `single_agent_mode`: Default `False`. `True` if using single agent mode, i.e., Gym style interface with other players as pretrained/rule models.
	*   `active_player`: Defualt `0`. If `single_agent_mode` is `True`, `active_player` will specify operating on which player in single agent mode.
	*   `record_action`: Default `False`. If `True`, a field of `action_record` will be in the `state` to record the historical actions. This may be used for human-agent play.
	*   Game specific configurations: These fields start with `game_`. Currently, we only support `game_player_num` in Blackjack.

Once the environemnt is made, we can access some information of the game.
*   **env.action_num**: The number of actions.
*   **env.player_num**: The number of players.
*   **env.state_space**: Ther state space of the observations.
*   **env.timestep**: The number of timesteps stepped by the environment.

### What is state in RLCard
State is a Python dictionary. It will always have observation `state['obs']` and legal actions `state['legal_actions']`. If `allow_raw_data` is `True`, state will also have raw observation `state['raw_obs']` and raw legal actions `state['raw_legal_actions']`.

### Basic interfaces
The following interfaces provide a basic usage. It is easy to use but it has assumtions on the agent. The agent must follow [agent template](docs/developping-algorithms.md). 
*   **env.set_agents(agents)**: `agents` is a list of `Agent` object. The length of the list should be equal to the number of the players in the game.
*   **env.run(is_training=False)**: Run a complete game and return trajectories and payoffs. The function can be used after the `set_agents` is called. If `is_training` is `True`, it will use `step` function in the agent to play the game. If `is_training` is `False`, `eval_step` will be called instead.

### Advanced interfaces
For advanced usage, the following interfaces allow flexible operations on the game tree. These interfaces do not make any assumtions on the agent.
*   **env.reset()**: Initialize a game. Return the state and the first player ID.
*   **env.step(action, raw_action=False)**: Take one step in the environment. `action` can be raw action or integer; `raw_action` should be `True` if the action is raw action (string).
*   **env.step_back()**: Available only when `allow_step_back` is `True`. Take one step backward. This can be used for algorithms that operate on the game tree, such as CFR.
*   **env.is_over()**: Return `True` if the current game is over. Otherewise, return `False`.
*   **env.get_player_id()**: Return the Player ID of the current player.
*   **env.get_state(player_id)**: Return the state that corresponds to `player_id`.
*   **env.get_payoffs()**: In the end of the game, return a list of payoffs for all the players.
*   **env.get_perfect_information()**: (Currently only support some of the games) Obtain the perfect information at the current state.

### Running with multiple processes
RLCard now supports acceleration with multiple processes. Simply change `env_num` when making the environment to indicate how many processes would be used. Currenly we only support `run()` function with multiple processes. An example is [DQN on blackjack](docs/toy-examples.md#running-multiple-processes)

For your information, there is a nice online evaluation platform [pokerwars](https://github.com/pokerwars) that could be connected with RLCard with some modifications.
